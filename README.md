# Pi with Monte Carlo

Estimating pi using a simulation using the [Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method), randomly placing numbers on a square with a circle in it. The more numbers you place, the more likely accurate the result will be.

This program was created entirely using [Github Copilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot), I did not manually write a single line of code, only gave text descriptions of what i want the functions to do, and edited small sections.
